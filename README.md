In this activity, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogues the microbes that colonise human navels.

The dashboard shows the background of each individual and what type of bacteria was found in that person's belly.
